        <h4>INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
        <p><strong>Task: </strong>You will be presented with a series of question-response pairs. Your task is to carefully read each question and its corresponding response and provide a rating for the response. </p>
        <p><strong>Rating criteria: </strong> Provide a rating based on your judgment of the quality, relevance and overall appropriateness of the response. Make sure you understand the context and take your time to provide the rating.</p>
        <p> <strong>Rating Scale: </strong>Please use the following rating scale to evaluate the question-response pairs: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (worst) - the output is terrible, it’s completely useless and/or does not answer the question</li>
            <li>7 (best) - the output is almost perfect, I can’t think of a way to make it much better.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Study Time: </strong>The study will run for approximately 15-20 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Procedure:</strong> </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the “Next” button to go to the next question.</li>
            <li>You cannot move to the next question unless you provide a response for the current one.</li>
            <li>Be sure to read each question carefully, as attention checks will be used at random points in the study.</li>
            <li>Once you have completed all questions, please click the "Submit" button to finalize your responses.</li>
        </ul>
