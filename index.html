        <h4>INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
        <p>Thank you for participating in our study! In this task, you will be presented with a series of question-response pairs. Your task is to carefully read each question and its corresponding response and provide a rating based on your judgment of the quality and appropriateness of the response. Your responses will be reviewed for completeness and accuracy.</p>
        <p> <strong>Rating Scale</strong> Please use the following rating scale to evaluate the question-response pairs: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>7 (best) - the output is almost perfect, I can’t think of a way to make it much better.</li>
            <li>1 (worst) - the output is terrible, it’s completely useless and/or does not answer the question</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The study will run for approximately 30 minutes. This is ample time to evaluate each QA pair during this period. Use the “next” button to go to the next question. You cannot move to the next question unless you provide a response for the current one.</p>
        <p> <strong>Submit Answers: </strong>Once you have rated all the QA pairs, please click the "Submit" button to finalize your responses.</p>
        <p> <strong>Contact Information: </strong>If you have any questions or encounter issues during the study, please contact us at ttripathi@umass.edu</p>
