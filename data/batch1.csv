"Why does mixing lights result in a different color than mixing paint? For example, green + red = yellow in lights ,and brown in paint. Why does this happen?","Sources of light use what's called an additive color model . Each source adds new wavelengths, thus the collective light is the sum of all sources. Thus when you have a red and green light, your eyes are receiving both red and green bands of light. Paints and pigments use a subtractive color model. In this case, the material absorbs some wavelengths and reflects others. No new wavelengths are added. Thus mixing colored paints, it will absorb more colors, causing fewer wavelengths to be reflected back. If mathematically inclined, think of additive sources as a union and substractive pigments as an intersect.","The light you see is a result of what light is being reflected by an object. So if you shine green with red, you see yellow in light. But paints differ in the color they absorb. So mixing red (which absorbs blue and yellow lights but reflects red) and green (which absorbs red and reflects blue and yellow) together gives you something that absorbs red, blue, and yellow. If they were perfectly opposed, you'd make black. Instead, you usually end up with brown because the two paints aren't diametrically opposed.","question",""
"Why isn't there thunder and lightning during a snowstorm? Because aren't rain and snow basically the same thing, except one is colder?","A thunderstorm is formed in part by the strong upward motion of warm moist air. In conditions suitable for snow, it's less common to have a situation where you'll have upward moving warm moist air (it's usually not warm!), so it tends to take certain infrequent circumstances to generate, like moving over a large and warm lake, to generate the needed air movement.","We occasionally get thundersnow. But my guess is that cold weather fronts don't have the same kind of turbulent air currents that create static charges that hot air currents do.","question",""
"How are movies edited to be in 3D when they are't originally filmed in 3D ? Like Lord of the Rings","They have a bunch of people cut out the foreground from the background (rotoscoping) and place it in depth using software. They move stuff around and paint out the seams. Then they re-render the movie from two virtual cameras. Turns out a lot people aren't very discerning when it comes to 3d, and it's cheaper and less hassle than using two cameras during the shoot.","For films that use a lot of green and blue screen (LOTR, Avatar, Avengers), the CG background can be made as a 3D object. That way, the only thing that they have to make 3D in post are the actors, and they're separated already.  Also, many older films that used the red and blue glasses were three frames: One that was red, one was blue, and one that was full color. One of the red and blue frames was offset in order to create depth to the image.","question",""
"Steering a hot air balloon- how is it done ? Are you simply subject to the wind 's whim ?","Yes, you're subject to the wind's whim, but you have a good idea where it's coming from at different altitudes; you get a thorough meteorological overview beforehand. You can then \"" steer \"" by changing altitude to where the wind blows the direction you want to go. Which will not be very flexible, so you do know the general direction beforehand, and can predict your flight path relatively well. Not to mention that you don't go hot - air ballooning with a lot of wind in the first place.","Winds at different altitudes are going in different directions. Let's say the winds at 500 - 700 ft are SW - NE but from 700 - 900 they are W - E. You can adjust how far North and how far East you eventually get by varying your altitude between the two currents of winds. You're not likely to find completely opposing wind currents though, so it 's not like you can navigate very sharply.  All in all, you are * mostly * at the whim of the winds, but with some level of rudimentary control.","question",""
"If our skin is constantly ridding itself of dead cells and regenerating , why and how do freckles and other ' imperfections ' remain ?","The skin that is sloughed off is mostly the top layer of your skin (the epidermis). You can still have imperfections, scar tissue, pigmented cells (freckles), etc under or embedded in the part that sloughs off.","The cells that are sloughing off are different to the cells which pigment the skin. The cells which pigment the skin (melanocytes) are in the epidermis directly attached to the dermis. They never really move and hardly ever make new ones. This is why scars don't have pigment. The skin cells people talk about falling off (keratinocytes) are constantly produced by other keratinocytes which are also attached to the dermis.","question",""

"What are the dark circles under our eyes when we're extremely tired? It isn't bruising, so what's happening?","Imagine they take away your chair in kindergarten class. They make you stand there all day and never sit down. Imagine how tired you would be after all day. Not what if you forgot to go home from school and stayed there all night too!!! Well, the muscles holding up your perky little face and eye lids gets tired too, and after a long day, wants some rest. So it droops down a relaxed a bit, but then the blood has a harder time flowing through, and gets all stuck up under your eye for a little while, making it darker","From this random article I found (any Dermatologist or Optometrist might be able to provide more details):The skin below the eye is much thinner than normal skin , around 0.5 mm compared to 2 mm . When the body is tired , production of the chemical cortisol is dramatically increased to help give you the energy you need to stay awake. Among many other things, cortisol actually increases the volume of the blood in your body, which causes the blood vessels (including the ones below your eyes) to engorge to accommodate it. As we've already mentioned, dark circles are mostly caused by us seeing our blood vessels blood through our skin, so it stands to reason that when those blood vessels are engorged, they'd be easier to see, even in people who may have been blessed with thicker skin below their eyes.","question",""
"Why Do Slightly Opened Car Windows Make That Awful Sound When I'm driving down the road, I can roll down a back window slightly and i get a god awful sound. It 's rythmic and kills your ears. What causes this?","It's called Buffeting and it's caused by the air slamming *into* the car with no where to go. Crack one of the front windows, even just a tiny bit, to negate it.","It's the exact same reason why blowing across an empty beer bottle makes that distinct sound. Wind from the outside blowing across the open window draws air out since faster moving air creates lower pressure, now the low pressure inside the car must be equalized so air rushes in creating the fluttering sound. Solution: open two windows","question",""
"How is Gravity Equivalent to Acceleration? (General Relativity)","Imagine that you are in a room with no windows. There is no experiment that you can do inside that room to tell the difference between being on the surface of the Earth and being accelerated in outer space with a force of 1 gravity. You could jump. You could weigh yourself on a scale. You could drop a ball and measure how long it takes to fall. Everything you try will be exactly the same. This is the sense in which they are equivalent.","Here's the simple example. Say you're falling in a vacuum near the Earth 's surface, you experience a force: F = g x m; this force causes you to accelerate down as m x a = g x m therefore a = g regardless of your mass.","question",""
"Why we experience the sensation of falling in our dreams when we wake up? What causes this sensation? Why is it so seemingly universal and why is it so vivid relative to other physical sensations we experience in our dreams?","When you're in between deep sleep and the lighter sleep where it's easy to wake up, the sleep paralysis that stops you from acting out your dreams can do strange shit. Sometimes you'll be surfacing to wakefulness again when your brain accidently throws the sleep paralysis switch again. The sudden tension in the body can feel like falling to a sleep - frazzled mind, and it galvanizes you strongly it can even create the sensation you'd dropped onto the bed and bounced. You didn't. Your body just got switched into safe mode by accident.","It's almost like a muscle reflex. Your muscles relax and then jerk you back awake. It's usually referred to as a 'hypnic jerk'. There's a lot of theories why it happens. Some relate it to anxiety, or being overtired. Others have said that it's your brain telling your muscles to jerk in order to wake you up, even if it's irrational because you're dreaming.","question",""
"Why is it that in a dark or nearly dark room people can see objects better when they don't look directly them? Is it just how our eyes adjust to the darkness or something to do with the cones and rods?","Its do with both. When its dark, your pupils dilate letting more light in. However that doesn't explain why you see better when you don't look directly at an object. It turns out when you're looking directly at something, the light is'nt going all around the inside of your eye, its focused on a very small point a mm or two large. its called the fovea, the yellow spot or the macula lutea (put simply). This spot is where almost all of your cones (colored vision) cells are. Most of the rest of the eye is made of rods. Now colored vision is'nt particularly useful in the dark, so when we want to see in the dark, we want to focus light on the rods. We do this by looking slightly to the sides so the light hits the rods instead of the fovea."," ""Because more light sensing cells are in the edges of your retina. It actually has to do with motion detection. Any amount of movement will cause a change in light, and it spokes the little caveman in your brain, making you notice it better.","question",""

"Can an individual's genetic makeup make that person ""immune"" to cancer ? ""Immune"" is in quotes because it's not an infection, obviously. Can a person be more susceptible or less susceptible to cancerous formations due to his genes?","Yes .The scary truth is that people get cancer all the time, but usually their body is able to fight it off so early there are not ill effects. Some people's bodies are better at this than others, and genetics plays a big role in that.","Cancer, in most cases is caused by damage to DNA. This results in uncontrolled cell division. This occurs frequently in dividing cells. However the body is able to identify those mutated cells by abnormal proteins on the cell surface, in most cases. The immune system is then able to destroy those cells and prevent further cell proliferation. Following that logic, people with immune systems that have better recognition of mutated cells would be less likely to develop symptomatic cancer.","question",""
"Why are stormclouds gray when normal clouds are white?

When it's raining and you look up, you're not seeing the clouds, you're seeing the shadow of the clouds.","The clouds are thicker and thus in shadow instead of glowing with refracted sunlight.

"What has changed that we frequently now throw away products instead of fixing them? Is it the quality or nature of the products themselves, or more cultural in origin ?","It's three fold: * Stuff is cheaper to mass produce now then it used to be, making it easy to replace something* Fixing something that's broken is almost always not a mass - production task. It require human time and effort and unique problem solving skills depending on the issue. This has always been expensive, and is still expensive today. * Many things today are completely impossible for the average person to fix, often not due to people trying to prevent it, but because things are so complicated today, that it 's nearly impossible to be able to fix all the kinds of things you use, compared to 200 years ago when you only used a small set of tools and items which were all relatively simple.","Planned obsolescence is the term.

"Why is NASA's Space launch center based in Florida? As compared to any other state.","Spacecrafts launch eastward, so that the Earth's rotation helps them get into orbit. Any space launch center will want a giant empty area to the East, so that nobody will get hurt if a rocket explodes or crashes on launch. For the Soviets, that giant empty area was the Kazach steppe and Siberia; for the Americans it was the Atlantic Ocean- It's warm enough that they can launch almost 365 days a year. - It 's relatively close to NASA's supply contractors, and accessible by barge. This was important because the gigantic Saturn first stage was only transportable by barge.","2 main reasons, both because of the Earth's rotation on its axis: 1. The earth moves faster at the equator, so by using this velocity it is easier to get into orbit. 2. To use the rotational velocity, the rocket must launch moving eastwards. Often, rockets drop components, and it is better to have them land in the Atlantic than in, say, Texas.","question",""
"If humans never existed on the planet and never began destroying it, would Earth and all its species just continue on living in harmony?

Most of all species that have ever been are extinct, and humanity has only relatively recently added to the pile.","Natural harmony is, essentially, a lie. All species are trying to survive for their own benefit exclisively. Given the opportunity, any given species will overpopulate an area, causing an eventual population crash due to lack of resources.
