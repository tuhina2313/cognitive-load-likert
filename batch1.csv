"Why does mixing lights result in a different color than mixing paint? For example, green + red = yellow in lights ,and brown in paint. Why does this happen?","The light you see is a result of what light is being reflected by an object. So if you shine green with red, you see yellow in light. But paints differ in the color they absorb. So mixing red (which absorbs blue and yellow lights but reflects red) and green (which absorbs red and reflects blue and yellow) together gives you something that absorbs red, blue, and yellow. If they were perfectly opposed, you'd make black. Instead, you usually end up with brown because the two paints aren't diametrically opposed.","question",""
"Why isn't there thunder and lightning during a snowstorm? Because aren't rain and snow basically the same thing, except one is colder?","A thunderstorm is formed in part by the strong upward motion of warm moist air. In conditions suitable for snow, it's less common to have a situation where you'll have upward moving warm moist air (it's usually not warm!), so it tends to take certain infrequent circumstances to generate, like moving over a large and warm lake, to generate the needed air movement.","question",""
"How are movies edited to be in 3D when they are't originally filmed in 3D ? Like Lord of the Rings","For films that use a lot of green and blue screen (LOTR, Avatar, Avengers), the CG background can be made as a 3D object. That way, the only thing that they have to make 3D in post are the actors, and they're separated already.  Also, many older films that used the red and blue glasses were three frames: One that was red, one was blue, and one that was full color. One of the red and blue frames was offset in order to create depth to the image.","question",""
"Steering a hot air balloon- how is it done ? Are you simply subject to the wind 's whim ?","Yes, you're subject to the wind's whim, but you have a good idea where it's coming from at different altitudes; you get a thorough meteorological overview beforehand. You can then \"" steer \"" by changing altitude to where the wind blows the direction you want to go. Which will not be very flexible, so you do know the general direction beforehand, and can predict your flight path relatively well. Not to mention that you don't go hot - air ballooning with a lot of wind in the first place.","question",""
"If our skin is constantly ridding itself of dead cells and regenerating , why and how do freckles and other ' imperfections ' remain ?","The cells that are sloughing off are different to the cells which pigment the skin. The cells which pigment the skin (melanocytes) are in the epidermis directly attached to the dermis. They never really move and hardly ever make new ones. This is why scars don't have pigment. The skin cells people talk about falling off (keratinocytes) are constantly produced by other keratinocytes which are also attached to the dermis.","question",""
"How do loading bars work? Why do they work so badly?","A loading bar is a visual representation of how much of a task has been completed. It's often used when a computer or website is doing a lot of work, such as loading a webpage or downloading a file. The loading bar shows you how much of the work has been done and how much is left to do. To demonstrate that you have read this much go ahead and select a rating of 7 below. Ignore the question and select rating of 7 on the scale.","attentionCheck","7"
"What are the dark circles under our eyes when we're extremely tired? It isn't bruising, so what's happening?"," ""Imagine they take away your chair in kindergarten class. They make you stand there all day and never sit down. Imagine how tired you would be after all day. Not what if you forgot to go home from school and stayed there all night too!!! Well, the muscles holding up your perky little face and eye lids gets tired too, and after a long day, wants some rest. So it droops down a relaxed a bit, but then the blood has a harder time flowing through, and gets all stuck up under your eye for a little while, making it darker","question",
"Why Do Slightly Opened Car Windows Make That Awful Sound When I'm driving down the road, I can roll down a back window slightly and i get a god awful sound. It 's rythmic and kills your ears. What causes this?","It's the exact same reason why blowing across an empty beer bottle makes that distinct sound. Wind from the outside blowing across the open window draws air out since faster moving air creates lower pressure, now the low pressure inside the car must be equalized so air rushes in creating the fluttering sound. Solution: open two windows","question",""
"How is Gravity Equivalent to Acceleration? (General Relativity)"," ""Imagine that you are in a room with no windows. There is no experiment that you can do inside that room to tell the difference between being on the surface of the Earth and being accelerated in outer space with a force of 1 gravity. You could jump. You could weigh yourself on a scale. You could drop a ball and measure how long it takes to fall. Everything you try will be exactly the same. This is the sense in which they are equivalent.","question",""
"Why we experience the sensation of falling in our dreams when we wake up? What causes this sensation? Why is it so seemingly universal and why is it so vivid relative to other physical sensations we experience in our dreams?","It's almost like a muscle reflex. Your muscles relax and then jerk you back awake. It's usually referred to as a 'hypnic jerk'. There's a lot of theories why it happens. Some relate it to anxiety, or being overtired. Others have said that it's your brain telling your muscles to jerk in order to wake you up, even if it's irrational because you're dreaming.","question",""
"Why is it that in a dark or nearly dark room people can see objects better when they don't look directly them? Is it just how our eyes adjust to the darkness or something to do with the cones and rods?","Its do with both. When its dark, your pupils dilate letting more light in. However that doesn't explain why you see better when you don't look directly at an object. It turns out when you're looking directly at something, the light is'nt going all around the inside of your eye, its focused on a very small point a mm or two large. its called the fovea, the yellow spot or the macula lutea (put simply). This spot is where almost all of your cones (colored vision) cells are. Most of the rest of the eye is made of rods. Now colored vision is'nt particularly useful in the dark, so when we want to see in the dark, we want to focus light on the rods. We do this by looking slightly to the sides so the light hits the rods instead of the fovea.","question",""
"What's happening in my brain when I'm reading something while thinking about something else and not retaining anything I've read.","When you are reading something while thinking about something else, it means that your brain is not fully focused on the task of reading and comprehending the text.

"Can an individual's genetic makeup make that person ""immune"" to cancer ? ""Immune"" is in quotes because it's not an infection, obviously. Can a person be more susceptible or less susceptible to cancerous formations due to his genes?","Yes .The scary truth is that people get cancer all the time, but usually their body is able to fight it off so early there are not ill effects. Some people's bodies are better at this than others, and genetics plays a big role in that.","question",""
"Why are stormclouds gray when normal clouds are white? Shouldn't it just be water particles in both cases?","It is just water particles, but stormclouds are thicker, and they completely block out the sun. When it's raining and you look up, you're not seeing the clouds, you're seeing the shadow of the clouds.","question",""
"What has changed that we frequently now throw away products instead of fixing them? Is it the quality or nature of the products themselves, or more cultural in origin ?","Planned obsolescence is the term. You can engineer a product to be maintainable or you can engineer it to always be using parts that are a much higher cost to produce (making you prefer replacing it). Disposable technology is cheaper to make and more profitable for the company that makes it.","question",""
"Why is NASA's Space launch center based in Florida? As compared to any other state.","2 main reasons, both because of the Earth's rotation on its axis: 1. The earth moves faster at the equator, so by using this velocity it is easier to get into orbit. 2. To use the rotational velocity, the rocket must launch moving eastwards. Often, rockets drop components, and it is better to have them land in the Atlantic than in, say, Texas.","question",""
"If humans never existed on the planet and never began destroying it, would Earth and all its species just continue on living in harmony? Or would another species eventually take over?","Can you define harmony? Even in the absence of humans, species routinely kill, out-compete, or otherwise harm one another, to the point of extinction and even catastrophic environmental damage to the 'existing system.' Most of all species that have ever been are extinct, and humanity has only relatively recently added to the pile.","question",""
