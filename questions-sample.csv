"How was airplane technology able to advance so quickly after the Wright Brothers' first flight ? Mainly interested in how aviation was able to be deployed on a large scale during WWI."" ","This is a frequent phenomenon with technology : something is considered very hard or even impossible for a long , long time , and then one day , somebody figures it out . That opens a whole FLOODGATE of discovery leading to discovery , and the technology leaps forward quickly . Eventually , those chains of discovery start to play out , and the rate of advancement slows down , and may even come to a halt , perhaps starting up again years later when somebody discovers something new . We saw the same phenomenon with the building of the first transistor in 1947 . The * theory * of transistors had actually been known since the early 20th century , but nobody had figured out a way to actually build one . That led to an explosion in electronics , and when somebody figured out how to put a load of teensy transistors on a silicon wafer, the explosion exploded .", "question"
"Why does mixing lights result in a different color than mixing paint ? for example green + red = yellow in lights , and brown in paint . why does this happened.","Sources of light use what's called an additive color model . Each source adds new wavelengths , thus the collective light is the sum of all sources . Thus when you have a red and green light , your eyes are receiving both red and green bands of light . Paints and pigments use a subtractive color model . In this case , the material absorbs some wavelengths and reflects others . No new wavelengths are added . Thus mixing colored paints , it will absorb more colors , causing fewer wavelengths to be reflected back . If mathematically inclined, think of additive sources as a union and substractive pigments as an intersect.", "question"
"What is the multiverse theory?", "The intriguing multiverse thoery posits that our universe is just one among many, offering a mind-bending perspective on the nature of reality and the possibilities beyond our observable cosmos.

"Why is n't there thunder and lightning during a snowstorm ? Because are n't rain and snow basically the same thing , except one is colder ?","A thunderstorm is formed in part by the strong upward motion of warm moist air . In conditions suitable for snow , it 's less common to have a situation where you 'll have upward moving warm moist air ( it 's usually not warm ! ) , so it tends to take certain infrequent circumstances to generate , like moving over a large and warm lake , to generate the needed air movement.", "question"
